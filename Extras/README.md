-- Details Pt.2

Old New Explorer - Old New Explorer DOES NOT modify any system files, as such it is safe to use and WILL NOT break anything as it is.

StartIsBack++ - StartIsBack++ does NOT modify any system files, and as suchis safe to use and WILL NOT break anything. Albeit there is the occasional explorer.exe crash of which simply refreshes explorer.exe [some find this to be annoying but it does no harm].

AeroGlass for Win8+ - AeroGlass for Win8+ IS a system mod. As such it has multiple versions. Each version will only work on SPECIFIC builds of Windows 8 and or Windows 10. As such if you use a version that IS NOT built for the OS of build you are currently running, YOU WILL bork your system. So be very careful when running AeroGlass as I am NOT responsible for anyone who borks their system by not paying attention to details on the website.
