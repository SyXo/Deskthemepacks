-- Details Pt.2

Old New Explorer - Old New Explorer DOES NOT modify any system files, as such it is safe to use and WILL NOT break anything as it is.

StartIsBack++ - StartIsBack++ does NOT modify any system files, and as suchis safe to use and WILL NOT break anything. Albeit there is the occasional explorer.exe crash of which simply refreshes explorer.exe [some find this to be annoying but it does no harm].

AeroGlass for Win8+ - AeroGlass for Win8+ IS a system mod. As such it has multiple versions. Each version will only work on SPECIFIC builds of Windows 8 and or Windows 10. As such if you use a version that IS NOT built for the OS of build you are currently running, YOU WILL bork your system. So be very careful when running AeroGlass as I am NOT responsible for anyone who borks their system by not paying attention to details on the website. 

T-Clock Redux - T-Clock Redux works mostly fine on Windows 8 - 10. It has some items which are intended for certain builds, however it states within the program which builds they will and will not work on. So long as you don't do anything it tells you not to, you should have no problems with it.
